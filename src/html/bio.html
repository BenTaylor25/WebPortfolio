                    I am a student of Computer Science at Oxford Brookes University. <br>
                    I am interested in Software Development/Engineering, Game Development, and Web Development, <br>
                    and am keen to pursue a career in one of these areas after I graduate. <br>
                    I am also interested in the subjects of Psychology, Language, History, and Philosophy. <br>
                    I have hobby interests in Story Analysis, Video Games, and Rubik's Cubes. <br>
                    I can solve a standard Rubik's cube in under a minute, and can solve any n-by-n cube (my largest is 9x9). <br>

                    Python was my introduction to programming in 2015. I was first exposed
                    to it at school, but extended my knowledge past the curriculum and
                    started making small tests. In 2018, I started tutoring programming using
                    the Fuze Basic language, which was replaced with Fuze4 Nintendo Switch
                    when the latter was released in 2019. As a member of the Fuze team, however,
                    I had the chance to test early builds of the language. In 2020 I was studying
                    Computer Science at A-Level. At this time, I learned basic SQL as part of the
                    course, and elected to learn C++ for use in my final project (see Billiards
                    in the Projects tab for more). In late 2021 I taught myself Java ahead of my
                    Obejct-Oriented Programming module at Oxford Brookes the following semester.
                    Shortly after, in 2022, I began experimenting with Git and GitHub, and have
                    used both frequently since. In early 2022, I also had the opportunity to
                    join a Software Development scheme with DigiVue, which required me to learn 
                    C# and gain some familiarity with GitLab. A few months later, I decided to
                    try out JavaScript and TypeScript with NodeJS. I quickly moved to HTML and
                    CSS, in order to build this site, which required a bit of JS, but didn't 
                    really elicit TS. Node and TS have thus taken a bit of a backseat but I 
                    intend to revisit them both over the summer break. I would also like to 
                    learn VueJS, as this is the frontend framework used by DigiVue, and C as I
                    have a C/C++ Software Development module next year in the first semester
                    as well as brushing up on my Java, C#, C++, and SQL.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2023 I would like to learn the Rust and Go languages as well as the 
                    Angular, Tauri, and ElectronJS frameworks.
