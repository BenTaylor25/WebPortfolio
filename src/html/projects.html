                        They were paying a large sum of money for a mediocre website. <br>
                        I developed a new, better-organised site to replace it.

                        I have also seen the web CVs of others and I thought this would be beneficial to me. <br>
                        Regardless of its benefit, I have enjoyed learning how to make web apps.

                        Having studied Computer Science longer than many of my peers, I have been able to <br>
                        explore beyond my modules, and this was a good opportunity to test myself. <br>
                        I used LibGDX for graphical output.

                        Before I started at University, I had heard that completing a degree is useful but <br>
                        to fully display your skills, you need to have a few projects to showcase. <br>
                        I am aiming for full time work in Software Engineering / Development, but I am also <br>
                        keen on Game Development. I wanted one of my projects to be Game Development focused. <br>
                        This project required story writing and planning as well as programming.

                        I created a simulation of Pool and Snooker for my A-Level Computer Science Project.<br>
                        This involved learning how Billiard balls collide with the cushion and each other; <br>
                        a branch of mathematics called elastic collisions in two dimensions. <br>
                        I had to learn how to use matrices to rotate vectors in order to perform the collision calculations. <br>
                        I used the olcPixelGameEngine for basic graphical output and mouse input. <br>
