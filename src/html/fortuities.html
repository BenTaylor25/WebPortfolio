                        Student Representative at Oxford Brookes from 2021 to present

                    <h3>
                        My primary focuses at <a href="https://www.brookes.ac.uk/">Oxford Brookes</a> 
                        are to learn valuable skills to help me with my career, and to earn a degree 
                        qualification to show for. Despite this, I recognise that no programme is perfect,
                        and with my own experience in teaching programming along with
                        direct experience of being a student of the programme, I would like
                        to see the course improve for later students.
                        <br />
                        As a student representative, I am responsible for feeding back on
                        the student experience as a whole, from student life, to course specifics.
                        I have been part of several meetings where I have offered my thoughts.
                        Specifically, I recently commented on how many of the careers placement
                        offers were only relevant to certain people, and I believe that they are
                        working on way to filter opportunities for different students.

                        Old Swan and Minster Mill Hotel Presentation in 2018
                    </u></h2>
                    <h3>
                        During my GCSE studies, I had the opportunity to visit
                        the <a href="https://www.sae.edu/gbr">SAE Institute Oxford</a> for a tour.
                        <br />
                        Following this, I was one of four students selected for 
                        a further opportunity to give a presentation about the
                        tour (the other students visited different organisations).
                        We needed to prepare some slides to help with our presentations,
                        but when we arrived at the 
                        <a href="https://www.minstermill.co.uk/minster-mill-old-swan">
                            Old Swan and Minster Mill</a>, 
                        we found that the projector was not present.
                        This meant that we had to rely on verbal communication. 
                        As we had arrived early, we were able to do a few practice runs,
                        where my school's organiser noted that my wording was slightly
                        different every time and felt very fluid, which was due to me not 
                        reading my notes word-for-word.
                        <br />
                        Also in attendance at the presentation was Jon Silvera, Owner and
                        Managing Director of <a href="https://www.fuze.co.uk/">Fuze Technologies</a>. 
                        He told me about his company and I was so interested that I contacted him for
                        my school's Work Experience week, and ended up joining the team part time.
                        For more information about my time with Fuze, see the 
                        <a href="./work.html">Work</a> tab.
