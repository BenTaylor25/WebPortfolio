<h1>Web Portfolio</h1>

This is the first web project that I worked on. <br>
Late 2021, I found a YouTube tutorial for building web apps, and I decided to give it a go. I didn't end up learning much, as it was very do-this-now-do-this, but it gave me good exposure which helped when I decided to jump back into front end development in April 2022. As of May 2022, the project is 'finished', though as a portfolio, I hope to maintain it as I progress in my career.<br>
